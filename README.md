### Cold Call Strategy
_____
Obviously this is extremely customized depending on the company and product I work with.
This framework is from my time at Saltalk, when we sold no-contract based meal services to SMB and enterprise companies

***Opener***
Hey (name), Alex from Saltalk Here. We haven't talked before and I know you were not expecting my call, but I was hoping you could help me out.
***Context + question***
My company does very easy to use meal delivery for your employees,do you currently provide lunch for your employees?
If yes: Great! We helped other companies save around 20% on their current provider, and we don't require a contract
If no: Ok ! How many people do you currently have in office?
***Pitch***
We know providing lunch can be both time consuming and expensive, our solution does not require a contract and can help save you money and time compared to other solutions.
I was calling to see if you would be open to learn more about a different approach for lunch catering.
***Close***
Any interest in checking it out?

### Cold Email Strategy
_____
I always make it as customized as possible while using a basic framework.
All my leads are bucketed in different categories first so I can customize the multiple sequences campaigns properly.
Example, if I work for a company selling meal catering services (not contract based), I will have multiple sequences depending on the type of lead:
*Sequences:*
- Companies that have 100+ employees and have an existing meal provider
- Companies with 20-100 employees who have an existing contract-based meal provider
- Companies with 20-100 employees who have an existing no-contract based provider
- Companies where I do not have information on their current meal services
- Companies that used us in the past and churned

The customization points are multiple: current competitor used, size of company, personal info (from their linkedin/recent news)

#### Framework

- Introduction with an observation
- Framing a problem
- Solution to that problem
- Interest based CTA
