### Cold Call Strategy
_____
Obviously this is extremely customized depending on the company and product I work with.
This framework is from my time at Saltalk, when we sold no-contract based meal services to SMB and enterprise companies

***Opener***
Hey (name), Alex from Saltalk Here. We haven't talked before and I know you were not expecting my call, but I was hoping you could help me out.

***Context + question***
My company does very easy to use meal delivery for your employees,do you currently provide lunch for your employees?
If yes: Great! We helped other companies save around 20% on their current provider, and we don't require a contract
If no: Ok ! How many people do you currently have in office?

***Pitch***
We know providing lunch can be both time consuming and expensive, our solution does not require a contract and can help save you money and time compared to other solutions.
I was calling to see if you would be open to learn more about a different approach for lunch catering.

***Close***
Any interest in checking it out?

### Cold Email Strategy
_____
I always make it as customized as possible while using a basic framework.
All my leads are bucketed in different categories first so I can customize the multiple sequences campaigns properly.
Example, if I work for a company selling meal catering services (not contract based), I will have multiple sequences depending on the type of lead:
*Sequences:*
- Companies that have 100+ employees and have an existing meal provider
- Companies with 20-100 employees who have an existing contract-based meal provider
- Companies with 20-100 employees who have an existing no-contract based provider
- Companies where I do not have information on their current meal services
- Companies that used us in the past and churned

The customization points are multiple: current competitor used, size of company, personal info (from their linkedin/recent news)

#### Framework

- Introduction with an observation
- Framing a problem
- Solution to that problem
- Interest based CTA
  
### Objection Handling Examples
_____
Many of those are sourced from Josh Braun's sales training.

<ins>Can you send me an email?  </ins>
My response: I'll do that right away. Would it be okay if I asked you a couple of quick questions so I don't need to spam you with emails?

<ins>I'm not interested </ins>
My response: I know you didn't ask me to call you. Before we hang up, if you don't mind me asking, is it because I called at the worst  time, or are you happy with what you have?

<ins>I'm going into a meeting </ins>
My response: Sorry for the bad timing! Can I tell you why I'm calling to see if it's even worth calling back?

<ins>We are already under contract with X </ins>
My response: Thanks for letting me know! They have a great product, how satisfied are you with them? If you have a minute, I can explain to you how we are different and what painpoints we can solve.
